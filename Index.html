  <h2>Skills</h2> 
  <p>  I have experience in leadership roles as a Lead
  Line Cook as well as a very strong work ethic from working
  demanding positions in construction and restaurants. I work
  very well with others as all of my positions have required
  close cooperation to function smoothly and efficiently. I 
  also excel at coworker and customer relations, I have the 
  ability to leave my life at the door and be very personable 
  in my interactions while focusing on my work. </p>
  <h2>Technology Experience</h2>
  <p>I have always been fascinated with technology, but have withheld from pursuing it as a career path as I had thought it to be implausible. However I have educated myself in it out of sheer fascination. I taught myself how to code in HTML, CSS, and Python using online resources. I also learned how to be more than proficient in navigating the interworkings of an OS and troubleshooting various devices simply because it intrigued me. I am very familiar with command prompt, setting up a dual boot system, trouble shooting through boot dos and various other techniques.</p>
  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Dixies Southern Cuisine and Emmets public house<br/> This job I began as my first experience in the restaurant industry. I began as a prep cook and left the job as a lead line cook,my responsibilities ranged from running tickets, having knowledge of every station on the line, creating prep lists and taking inventory, to deep cleaning and stocking stations before and after "</li> 
    <li>Punch Pizza<br/> This was a very interesting job and much different from my previous restaurant experience. Punch pizza was an open kitchen in which customers would observe us as we worked and ask questions on their way to the register. This created an environment in which we maintained positive attitudes and a friendly manner to interact with the customers even during periods of very high stress where we were behind on tickets. While at this establishment I also gained experience with running expo, busing dishes, food running and working the cashier when it was needed. I left this job on good terms and only left because a better opportunity arose</li>
    <li>The French Hen<br/> I had a wide range of responsibilities at this establishment, I made specials for the weekend, wrote recipes for soup de jour, ran the line frequently by myself, cooking for the entire restaurant through breakfast and lunch service, deep cleaning at least the end of my shift, taking inventory and writing prep lists and other daily routines. At this job I was also taught how to make a variety of espresso drinks at our coffe bar. I left  this job with a full two weeks notice on very good terms with the owner and managers.</li>
    <li>Starbucks<br/> This is my current employer. Here I have taken a leadership role after a very short time. My roll here involves both a fast paced work enviornment, as it is located in one of the busiest targets in the nation, as well as smooth cooperation with my other team members. This job is actually the one that encompasses both the new skills I learned here as well as making use of the skills I acquired at previous jobs. I have to maintain a professional, friendly, attitude while also multitasking a large number of orders and keeping track of our inventory. On many days I am left in charge of organizing, stocking, ordering and prepping the store while also working on the espresso bar or in roll as the person of service on the register.</li>
